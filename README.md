# Advanced Monte Carlo Methods Library 
#### (Updated 6/23/2018)
The purpose of this library is to provide researchers in a wide variety of disciplines the means to use some advanced Monte Carlo
methodologies to solve Bayesian inference related problems. The library is implemented for MATLAB users, but we will also work on 
an extension in Python.
